# Text-Classification-using-RNNs
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive resource for text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the R programming language. Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and RNNs offer a powerful solution for capturing sequential dependencies in textual data.
